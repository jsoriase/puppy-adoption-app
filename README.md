## :scroll: Description
App that displays a list of puppies to be adopted
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The app was made in order to learn Compose UI and its current capabilities. I took a look to it some time ago and they made easier to navigate through composables with navigation component which its huge to me. Data is stored in a companion object but I will use this same project to look for easy implementations of the domain layer (MVI with coroutines seems a great fit!)
